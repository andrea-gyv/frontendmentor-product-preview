## My process

since being new to frontend development, i have started doing these excercises.
i have done a 90% good solution on my own and have found Kevin Powells youtibe channel with the exact same project video.
by following it along i have amended the mistakes that i made before.

so the code is a combination of my own and kevin powell's solution

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

for visually impaired people - semantic html with hidden elements that help screen readers read the page properly
use of grid

### Continued development

in html and css there are tons to learn, but i like when i see the good result that i was aiming for

## Acknowledgments
